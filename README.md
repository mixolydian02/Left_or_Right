# Left_or_Right

2/20/24 - Created the initial Master copy and prototype, fleshed out more of the right hand story.
2/23/24 - Finished most of the right side storyline. Also did a quick playtest of prototype, discussed how to indicate what achievements have been reached
RESULTS:
**need to finish storylines**
**Need to impliment a way to show what paths were taken (try a page off the main screen that shows an empty map that fills in when you go down the paths)**
**Consider having it show the last played history - if you started right last time then that button would be darker on the next play through but if you then choose left and return a third time, only the left woudl be darker)**
**need to finish connecting buttons to all pages**
